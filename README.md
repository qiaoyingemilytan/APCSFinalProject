# Final-Project
Group Name: Papa’s Javaria
Group member names: Qiao Ying (Emily) Tan, Meicheng Wang
Brief Project description:
You work at a restaurant called Papa’s Javaria. During your shift, many customers come up to you and ask for a specific order. You fulfill their orders by using the ingredients available to you and kitchen appliances in order to cook and create food. While making food for hungry customers, it is important to note that they will run out of patience if you take too long to prepare their order. You don’t want your customers to run out of patience or else they will leave, without paying, and give a bad review. The money your restaurant gets after each shift depends on the amount of customers that pay and tips. After each shift, you get a rating out of three stars, which is determined by the amount of money made during that shift. You can only go on to the next shift if you get a rating over one star. Use earned money to upgrade your restaurant’s kitchen and decor. Make your restaurant the most popular place to eat in the city.

Development Log

Meicheng Wang: I updated the Customer class so it has all the necessary methods. Also I initialized the food steps ArrayLists so that held specific instructions for making each food. These ArrayLists are compared to the order ArrayList to check if the order is correct.
